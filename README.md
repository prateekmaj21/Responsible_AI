### Assignment 1: Proxy Features

"Proxy features" in AI ethics are known as the hidden biases in data which the model learns and uses in the predictions or outcomes. Even if an AI model does not explicitly incorporate protected characteristics such as race, gender, or income, it can make use of other data points-colour discrimination, which would indirectly represent these characteristics-such as ZIP codes, job titles, or buying behaviour.

This project analyzes loan approval data, aiming to understand feature importance and mitigate potential biases.  It begins by preprocessing the data, including handling missing values and converting categorical features to numerical ones.  Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) is used to detect and address multicollinearity, identifying proxy variables that might introduce bias. Feature importance is then assessed using a Decision Tree Regressor and R-squared values, revealing the predictive power of each feature. The analysis identifies "Credit_History" as the most influential factor, while others may be proxy variables requiring further investigation to ensure fairness and transparency. 

### Assignment 2: Impact of Differential Privacy on Decision Tree Regression Performance

This project evaluates the impact of Differential Privacy (DP) on data utility and model performance using a Decision Tree Regressor. We trained four models: one on original data, one on DP-processed data, one with DP-enhanced training on original data, and one with DP-enhanced training on DP data. Key metrics such as RÂ² score, MAE, RMSE, and MAPE were analyzed to compare performance. The results indicate that while DP reduces data utility, DP-enhanced training helps mitigate performance loss. This study highlights the trade-off between privacy and predictive accuracy in machine learning.

### Assignment 4: Loan Approval Prediction with Reweighting Analysis

The project is focused on analyzing and predicting loan approval status. The code involves data preprocessing, handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and visualizing the impact of protected features on loan approval. A RandomForestClassifier is used to predict loan approval, and the dataset is checked for class imbalance, which is addressed through reweighting techniques. The project aims to build a fair and accurate model for loan approval prediction while considering the impact of various protected features.

### Assignment 5: Loan Approval Prediction with Reweighting using SK Learn 

The same as above, except the weights are passed using sklearn's model.fit(X,y,sample_weights).
